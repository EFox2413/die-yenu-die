			<b>Backstory</b>:<br>
			You are Marik, a Demonslayer. Many moons ago, the demon Lord Yenu slaughtered your village, or most of it anyway. A great wizard, Sir Phenemon, wounded Yenu, but at the cost of his own life.<br>
			Since that day, you seek Lord Yenu's death, and you will not rest easy until his cruel soul is in your hands.<br>
			You travel to Hell's Crypt, rumored to house Lord Yenu in its deepest levels. Oh, and it's crawling with the undead. Nobody said it would be easy.
